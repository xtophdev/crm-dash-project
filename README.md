This project showcases a dynamic Sales CRM Dashboard designed to provide key performance indicators (KPIs) and visual analytics for sales teams. 
The dashboard includes critical metrics such as total sales, new customers, revenue growth, and conversion rates, displayed in visually appealing KPI cards. 
Additionally, the dashboard features a sales performance chart, built using Chart.js, to highlight monthly sales and profit comparisons.
The project is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices. 
The project also incorporates a Dark Mode feature, (when enabled) enabling users to toggle between light and dark themes, enhancing the user experience in various lighting conditions.
This project demonstrates my proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chart.js, providing a solid foundation for building data-driven web applications.
